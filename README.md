## Resources 
### Read or watch:

* Binary tree (note the first line: Not to be confused with B-tree.) [https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/1F2x42-8vUbOmU4L1C1KMg]
* Data Structure and Algorithms - Tree [https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/QmcTMCkQyrgMjrqoWxYdhw]
* Tree Traversal [https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/QmcTMCkQyrgMjrqoWxYdhw]

## Learning Objectives
### General
* What is a binary tree
* What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
* What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
* What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
* What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
* What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree
## NOTE BIEN
### GitHub
* There should be one project repository per group. If you clone/fork/whatever a project repository with the same name before the second deadline, you risk a 0% score.
## Universal Compilation Flag for C files
* gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic
